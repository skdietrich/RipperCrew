## 📖 Overview
This repository contains the source code for the official digital companion to **Chicago Ripper Crew: Reboot** by Dr. Stephen Dietrich-Kolokouris. Set against the gritty backdrop of 1981 Chicago—a city recording nearly 700 murders a year—this project acts as a clinical excavation into one of the most haunting cases in American history.

The narrative follows the real-life reign of terror of Robin Gecht and his crew while weaving in the fictional hunt of Detective Sarah Novak, a woman forged by the cold-case murder of her sister.

## 🩸 Core Features

* **Forensic Mapping**: A visual investigation of key historical sites, including the "Chapel of Shadows" on North Natchez Avenue and the hunt along Division Street.
* **Victims Gallery**: A dedicated memorial honoring the light of the fallen, from the grit of Linda Sutton to the star-bound ambition of Rose Beck Davis.
* **Cinematic Trailer**: Integrated promotional media capturing the "noir" atmosphere of the 1980s West Side.

## 📁 Repository Structure

## 🕵️ Historical Context
The Ripper Crew's reign (1981–1982) was more than a crime spree; it was a mirror to Chicago's darkest soul. This project honors the survivors whose fire broke the case—Beverly Washington and Angel York—and ensures that the names of the victims are never reduced to mere footnotes in police files.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
This site is built with modern, responsive HTML5, CSS3 (using custom variables for the dark aesthetic), and vanilla JavaScript. It is optimized for hosting via **GitHub Pages**.
